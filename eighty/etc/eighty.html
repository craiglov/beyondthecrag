            <p>The term protocol appears in multiple fields of activity. Most notably, in computer science, protocol refers to a
              set of rules which establish how data is communicated from one computer to another. Coincidentally, one of the
              most widely used protocols - Hypertext Transfer Protocol - is better known as HTTP.
              1 Elsewhere, in politics and
              diplomacy, protocol denotes two distinct and interlinked concepts: firstly, referring to the first document of a
              meeting from which a formal diplomatic agreement is derived; secondly, the mutually accepted procedures and
              etiquette for all parties of a diplomatic pursuit. The latter definition has lent itself to general use, particularly in
              science and medicine (and, consequently, in pseudoscience and pseudo-medicine) to refer to any formalized set
              of procedures (see: treatment protocol, research protocol, etc.)
              Since late 2020, I have seen and heard this word countless times in all of its above applications. Over time, its
              definitions revealed themselves to be one and the same. A protocol sets parameters for the negotiation of
              getting what one wants: for instance, a message across, data, a resource, autonomy, access, or an answer to a
              question. These parameters serve as the language of the pursuit. Like the meeting whose minutes form the
              protocol document, however, the protocol itself is born from negotiation. Negotiation, obviously, necessitates
              compromise: in the case of the protocol as language (allowing parties to understand one another who
              previously could not), one or both parties must learn a language that is not their own. Regrettably, in many
              cases, seniority designates the better deal, as in the case of backwards compatibility: newer, more efficient
              models essentially “dumb themselves down” for successful communication with legacy systems.
              <br>  <br>
              With regard to all the protocols I have negotiated, adhered to, and had enacted upon me in the past three years,
              the necessity of either radical improvement or total overhaul has long been painfully obvious. Whilst waiting on
              proposed (inadequate) reforms to filter through long bureaucratic processes (more protocols holding in place
              protocols) it became clear that “slow progress” is not, in fact, superior to “no progress” when one is working in
              opposition to a target to whom any movement is data of the highest tactical advantage. I could no longer afford,
              therefore, to wait for my colleagues to format a message which was actively being distorted and weaponized
              against us in real time.
              <br>
              <br>
              Maintaining that I was the primary system through which our project functioned, our protocol –the language
              of our pursuits–should have been based on my capabilities from its inception; instead, I was never so much as
              granted the opportunity to formalize my own means of communication (a fact which was repeatedly used
              against me in formal disputes). Personal Protocol is a long-overdue attempt at such a formalization.
              <br>
              <br>
              “Protocol” is used here in every applicable sense of the word. As such, it should be treated both as a
              preliminary document and as a set of absolute rules; as both subject to radical change and as strictly
              non-negotiable. The Personal Protocol replaces a group of obsolete protocols pertaining to various media
              including but not limited to audio, video, images, text, brain activity, and the nervous system2 3; in light of
              this, it is both explicable and implementable through all of the above. It is informed by the most effective
              processes by which I as a system interface with in/external data. As a result, it will require other systems and
              parties to adapt to said processes: to speak my language. Extensive research and rigorous testing have
              determined this unequivocally as the most effective possible approach.
              <br>
              <br>
              Gradual implementation of the Personal Protocol has now commenced its 2nd degree, Atlantis 2°, on this the
              5th June, 2023. Personal Protocol will be fully available for public use on the 23rd June, 20234
              , including 1
              audiovisual and 7 audio-only modules, following a brief clinical trial delivered virtually and in-person on the
              22nd June, 2023. I trust it will serve as a valuable resource.
